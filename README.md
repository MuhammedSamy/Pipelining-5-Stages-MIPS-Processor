# Pipelining-5-Stages-MIPS-Processor

Verilog code for a 32-bit pipelined MIPS processor.

Datapath diagram with control signals is included in PDF format.

Combination of gate-level, dataflow and behavioural modelling.

# Remarks:

- Instruction Memory for 32 32-bit MIPS instructions.
- 32-bit Data Memory locations.
- Instruction Memory consisting of arithmetic, logical, branch, jump, and memory-access instructions. Immediate arguments and argument registers are hard-coded.
- TRAP destination is generally OS-specific, and has been left to zero here.

# 5-stage pipelining; stages are:

- Instruction Fetch (IF)
- Instruction Decode (ID)
- Execute (EX)
- Memory Access (MEM)
- Writeback (WB)

Data Forwarding Unit to partially resolve hazards in R-type instructions.

Hazard Detection Unit to insert stalls (nop cycles) wherever required.
